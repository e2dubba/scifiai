# sicifiai
A project to explore language models in the generation of Science Fiction short stories. 


## The Scope

One of the problems with text generation is it often doesn't follow a
narrative structure. We hope to adapt Joseph Campbell's monomyth, as a
structure to impose on the model as it generates SciFi short stories. 

The plan for this project is to tag each section of the stories with the
different phases of the monomyth. ![Image of the
